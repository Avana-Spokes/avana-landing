            Avana does not treat every AMM venue as interchangeable. Support depends on whether
            the protocol can price a position conservatively, unwind it in stressed conditions, and
            manage it within the Borrow Spoke and Hub risk framework.

            Whether a venue is enabled on a specific network is an operational question, not a
            protocol invariant. A venue family may be supported in principle but disabled on a given
            deployment until oracle coverage, liquidation routing, and risk parameters are in place.
