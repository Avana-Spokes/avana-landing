      term: "Lend Spoke",
      definition:
        "The lender-facing capital entry point that routes supplied assets into the Hub so Borrow Spokes can draw shared liquidity.",

      term: "Hub",
      definition:
        "The shared monetary layer in Aave v4 that manages liquidity, reserves, accounting, and protocol-wide capital coordination across connected spokes.",
    },
    {
      term: "Hub-and-Spoke Architecture",
      definition:
        "A design where shared capital lives in the Hub while collateral-specific logic is isolated in spokes. Avana uses this model because LP collateral needs venue-specific valuation and liquidation behavior.",
    },
    {
      term: "Liquidation Node",
      definition:
        "A protocol-operated runtime that indexes active positions and serves as a specialized liquidation backstop for complex LP collateral.",

    {
      term: "LP Position",
      definition:
        "A liquidity position from a supported AMM. Depending on the venue, it may be a fungible LP token, a concentrated-liquidity NFT, or another approved pool-share format.",
    },
    {
      term: "Collateral Factor",
      definition:
        "The portion of USD collateral value that may count toward borrowing power. In LP markets, this is applied at the position level rather than to the spoke as a whole.",
    },
    {
      term: "Borrowing Capacity",
      definition:
        "The amount a user can borrow inside a Borrow Spoke after each deposited LP position has been valued, risk-adjusted, and added to the user’s aggregate capacity.",
    },
    {
      term: "Allowed Pool",
      definition:
        "A governance-approved pool that meets admissibility requirements such as oracle coverage, liquidity depth, unwind quality, and spoke compatibility.",

      term: "Loan-to-Value (LTV)",

    },
    {
      term: "Borrow Rate",
      definition:
        "The rate borrowers pay on outstanding debt. It reflects both shared Hub conditions and LP-specific risk considerations.",
    },

      term: "Utilization Rate",
      definition:
        "The proportion of borrowed liquidity relative to available supply in the relevant Hub-connected capital layer.",

      term: "Risk Premium",
      definition:
        "The risk-specific component layered on top of base borrowing conditions to reflect the LP collateral profile being financed.",
    },
    {
      term: "Reserve Factor",
      definition:
        "The portion of protocol economics or interest flows reserved for the system rather than passed through entirely to liquidity suppliers.",
    },
  ],
  liquidationTerms: [
    {
      term: "Health Factor",
      definition:
        "The ratio between adjusted collateral value and outstanding debt inside a Borrow Spoke. When it falls too low, the position approaches liquidation eligibility.",
    },
    {
      term: "Liquidation",
      definition:
        "The process of repaying debt against an unhealthy LP-backed position, unwinding enough collateral to restore solvency, and returning any residual value after settlement.",
    },
    {
      term: "Liquidation Bonus",
      definition:
        "The liquidation premium paid to the party that executes the unwind, compensating them for capital use, routing complexity, and execution risk.",
    },
  ],
  oracleAndTransform: [
    {
      term: "Oracle",
      definition:
        "Avana’s valuation engine for LP collateral. It combines external asset prices, LP position reconstruction, and recoverable-value safeguards.",
    },
    {
      term: "Recoverable Value",
      definition:
        "The amount the protocol believes can realistically be realized during a stressed unwind after liquidation slippage, pool conditions, and risk buffers are considered.",
    },
    {
      term: "Transform",
      definition:
        "A controlled modification of a collateralized LP position, such as a rebalance or range change, that is only allowed when the resulting position still satisfies protocol health checks.",
    },
  ],
  metrics: [
    { term: "TVL", definition: "Total value of assets supplied as LP collateral or capital across Avana-connected components." },

  riskMitigation: [
    {
      term: "Pool Approval",
      definition:
        "The rule that only pre-approved pools may be admitted as collateral, limiting exposure to unsupported or weakly monitored markets.",
    },
    {
      term: "Recovery Haircut",
      definition:
        "A valuation discount applied so borrow power reflects recoverable unwind value rather than optimistic theoretical NAV.",
    },

      term: "Exposure Caps",
      definition:
        "Risk limits that bound borrowable exposure by pool family, collateral class, or liquidity depth.",

      definition:
        "A risk control that can pause or restrict actions when prices, market behavior, or protocol dependencies become inconsistent or unsafe.",
