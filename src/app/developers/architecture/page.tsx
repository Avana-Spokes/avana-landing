          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            The Borrow Spoke is the execution layer that lets LP holders use active liquidity
            positions as collateral. It is responsible for receiving LP positions, interpreting
            position metadata, applying oracle-aware valuation logic, enforcing health checks, and
            coordinating borrows against Hub liquidity.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            This page focuses on the borrower-facing side of the architecture. The separate Invest
            Spoke handles capital supply, while the Borrow Spoke handles LP-specific underwriting,
            monitoring, and liquidation behavior for each supported liquidity design.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong> LP collateral is structurally different from static
            assets, so the Borrow Spoke exists to translate pool composition, price range, fees, and
            market state into enforceable credit rules.
          </p>

        <section id="user-experience" className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="mb-4 type-section-title text-gray-900">User Experience</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Borrowers interact with the Borrow Spoke to supply LP collateral, borrow assets, manage
            open debt, repay balances, and claim earned fees. The spoke is designed to expose these
            flows through a single borrower-facing interface even when the underlying collateral types
            behave very differently across AMMs.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Transaction transparency:</strong> every action is paired with health factor
            updates, borrow-cap impact, and collateral-state context so borrowers can understand how
            a position change affects their loan in real time.

                Alice has 5 Uniswap v3 LP positions. She deposits her first LP as collateral:
                10,000 USDC and 5 ETH in the ETH/USDC pool (ETH price = $2,000), currently worth
                approximately $20,000 in total value.

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                The Borrow Spoke displays her ETH/USDC position and calculates that, with a 70%
                collateral factor, she can borrow up to $14,000. This is based on the lower-token
                collateral factor plus pool-specific risk adjustments.

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                Alice borrows $6,000 USDT, $500 WBTC, $2,000 LINK, $500 UNI, and $1,000 AVAX. Her
                total borrow is $10,000. She still has unused borrowing capacity, but her health
                factor is now in the yellow zone.

              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                Alice deposits 4 more LP positions worth $50,000 combined. After the Borrow Spoke
                values each position, her aggregate borrowing capacity expands and her health returns
                to a safer range without changing the underlying Hub capital source.

            The Borrow Spoke does not warehouse lender capital itself. Instead, it relies on the

            supplied by Lend Spoke depositors and other configured Hub sources.

                Assets such as USDC, DAI, and ETH are supplied into Hub-connected capital layers,
                including the Lend Spoke. The Hub sets macro-level pricing and accounting, while

                The Hub grants each Borrow Spoke a credit line defining how much borrowing capacity

                A user with LP collateral in multiple Borrow Spokes will have independent health
