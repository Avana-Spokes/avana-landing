              One of the most important sources of collateral demand in crypto is hiding in plain sight. For years,
              DeFi has treated AMMs primarily as trading infrastructure and LP positions as passive liquidity. Yet
              major AMMs already hold billions in liquidity, and the opportunity to make that capital usable as
              collateral has become increasingly difficult to ignore. AMMs are now more mature, liquidity is deeper,
              oracle infrastructure is stronger, and market participants are far more familiar with how LP positions
              behave across stable, correlated, and volatile pairs than they were in earlier generations of the market.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[0.98rem] font-normal leading-[1.65] tracking-[-0.025em] text-gray-900 sm:text-[1.08rem]">
              We believe the next major expansion in DeFi lending markets will come from protocols that can understand
              AMM liquidity, its risk, and its pool structure. That is why we are building Avana as a dedicated
              lending protocol for LP collateral across AMM markets, with specialized Aave v4 Spokes for different
              liquidity designs, a central Aave v4 Hub for shared borrowing liquidity, and an Aave v4 Invest Spoke
              that supplies the capital behind those markets.

              Avana is designed to transform AMM liquidity into structured collateral markets, allowing LP positions
              across hundreds of pools to participate in lending through architecture built specifically for their risk
              profile, pool design, and liquidity behavior.
